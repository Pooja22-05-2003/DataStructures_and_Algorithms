Given a number n, which denotes the size of the string and a number m , which denotes that maximum m numbers
we can reduce from the string.

So the cost is the square of the count of all the character and the total cost is sum of all these squares.
U need to minimize this sum, and the condition is that, we can remove at max m characrter.


Input1:
6
2
bacacc

Output 1:
6

Explaination:
a=2
b=1
c=3
(2)^2+(1)^2+(3)^2=> 14


Remove 2 c , ans=> (2)^2+(1)^2+(1)^2=>6
Input2:
15
3
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Output2:
144

Explaination:
Initital sum is (15)^2=> 225
Remove 3 x , now sum=> (12)^2=> 144
Constraints:
