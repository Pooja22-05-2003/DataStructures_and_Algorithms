/*
Approach :
1. Brute Force Approach will not work in this case.(T*n)=> (10^5*10^9)==> 10^14
2. If the number n=7 [111], then the most significant bit(is at 2nd bit ). we need to find a element which has 0 at the 2nd bit first time
and it should be smaller than 7.
3. Trick‚≠ê: (2^ith col-1) will definitely given 0 at the ith col.
Ex= (2^2-1)=3, 3 is the first element which has 0 at the 2nd col bit.

4. Now 2nd bit 0 is done.....but also we need to convert the first and 0th bit to 0.
5. The number greater than 3 , definitely contain 0 as the bit at 1st and 0th col.
6. 3=[011] , 4=[100], as u see here 4 contain 0 at both 0th and 1st bit.

7. So the problem boils down to, find the most significant bit(col) in n and return number(2^col-1).
