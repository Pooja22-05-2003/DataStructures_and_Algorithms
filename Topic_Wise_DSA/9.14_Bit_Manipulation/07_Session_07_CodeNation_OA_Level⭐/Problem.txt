Given an array A having N numbers, Coun the total number of valid subarray.
.Since the number can be very large , so print the answer%(1e9+7).

A valid Subarray=> By performing special moves, you can reduce it 
to an array of zeroes.

Special Move:
There is a special move allowed to u, in which you can select any two elements and subtract 2^i from each elements, 
if and only if their bitwise AND contains 1 at the ith bit.

Constraints:
1<=A[i]<=5*10^5.
0<=A[i]<=10^9.
