Given an array and Q Query, In each query 4 numbers (l1,l2,r1,r2) and 2 ranges , 1st range is (l1,r1) and 2nd range is (l2,r2).
Now for each query find the AND of numbers from (l1,r1)...lets say its result is x1 and AND of the second range number from (l2,r2) is x2
Now output the xor of the 2 numbers.

constraints:
1<=N<=10^5
1<=Q<=10^5
