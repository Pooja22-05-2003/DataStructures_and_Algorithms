/*
Problem in 1 Line. Given an array A. You can peform any number of operation u want.
In 1 operation u can pick the subarray with 1st and last as same element and remove that from the array.
.So after the all operations u need to return the minimum length of the array.

Ex:
input 1:
4
1 2 3 2

output1:
1 [ As we can remove the subarray (2,3,2)] , so remaining subarray is 1. and its legnth is 1.



Input2:
6
4 1 2 2 3 3

output :
2

As first we can remove the subarray(2,2) then the array left is [4 1 3 3]

After that we can remove(3,3). So the array left is [4 1] and its length is 2. So, answer is 2.



Approach :

1. One way you can think is that u will the the maximum length subarray with first and last element equal.but ther are more options after 
removing one subarray , u can even reomve the next subarray . So you can't do in this manner.
2. Actually in this question u need to think all the possible cases. And u will pick the best answer among all the possible answer.

3. Think about DPðŸ§ ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”:- In Do we explore all the possible paths and at last we pick the best from all those.
4. In dp, dp[i]= Represent the best answer till index i.
5. At each index 'i', u have 2 options , first is that u pick the current index element and the second option is thaat, u will not pick the current index
element at 'i' in your dp[i].
6. So here there is a need to introduce 1 more dp state. 
7. dp[i][0] represent the best answer to the question ,if u ignored the 'ith' element .
8. dp[i][1] represent the best answer to the question , if u picked the current 'ith' element .
9. So follow the dp pattern and try to formualte the best answer for index 'i'.


10. There is 1 dp array and there is 1 answer array.
In the answer array , we will store the best answer in ans[i].
11. dp[i][1]=1+ans[i-1] // u are taking the ith element
12. dp[i][1]= min ( move the j index from i-1 to 1 and check whether there any element similar to arr[i], if yes then option is ans[j-1] and take min all those possbile ans)
   
    ans[i]= min(dp[i][1] , dp[i][0])
