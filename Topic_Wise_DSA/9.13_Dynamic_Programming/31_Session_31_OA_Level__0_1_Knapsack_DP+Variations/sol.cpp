/*
Approach :

1. Why DPðŸ¤”ðŸ§ : It is because , At each index , we have multiple options , and at last we 
need to return the best possible answer.
2. So we need to explore all the possible cases. And we will use DP for that .
3. 1-D DP??? or 2-DP???--? Ans: 2-D Dp because we have 2 variables profit and weight and we need to both of them at each index.

4. At each index we have 2 options whether to pick the current element or to not pick the current element. (PICK/NOT PICK).
5. dp[i][j]=> It repersent the best answer till index i, when the capacity of the bag is j.
