Modified Version of Q-2 : We are given ‘2’ arrays . Select some elements from both of these arrays (select a subset) such that:-

--->1. Sum of those elements is maximum(Sum of the subset is maximum).

--->2. No 2 elements in the subset should be consecutive.(Note:-If you select, say the 5th element from Array-1, then you are not allowed 
to select 4th element from either 
Array-1 or Array-2 nor are you allowed to select the 5th element from Array -2 all of them are considered consecutive :-) )

Example:->

Array 1(a1) : {1,5,3,21234}

Array 2(a2) : {-4509,200,3,40}

Answer:- (200+21234=21434)
