Mr. Hola has an array A of size N and an integer B gifted to him by Mrs Hola.
The Aesthetic Value of the array is defined by the summation of 
[A[i]-A[i+B]] for all i from 1 to N-B.

You need to find the minimum Aesthetic Value possible for any permutaion of the array A.

For Example 


arr=[4,3,4,3,2,5]
B=3

Output:3

arr=[3,-5,3,-5,3]
B=2
output:
0

If u will see the example of the image or video.
Que changes to:

Arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]
k=4.

Divide the sorted array into X=3 sequence of len=4 and Y=1 sequence of length=3.

X,Y and lenght will change according to the questions.
