Q2 : Find LIS where each number is consecutive in the increasing sequence 



[200 ; 4 ; 5 ; 6 ; 7 ; 100 ; 8]

= 5 



Q3 : Find LIS where each number  in the increasing sequence each number has consecutive difference of k 



[100 ; 4 ; 5 ; 6 ; 7 ; 200 ; 8] ; k = 100 

= 2


(100,200) ==100 




Solution : update the bst map according to the number in the array not according to the index in the array ; if you know the best answer for any number ; say you are at b[i] ; you can quickly check or lookup in your map in O(1) the answer of 1 + map[b[i]-1]
