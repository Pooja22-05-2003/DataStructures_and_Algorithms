1.Given an array of even length.
2. Now there are 2 players in the game (Donnie and Ronnie).
3. Donnie will always start the game. and Donnie can play any startegy(Greedy and optimial), so difinitely Doniie play the optimal strategy.
4. Roniie will always play the greedy startegy.
5. Both the players take the alternate turns.
6. In any turn , player playing the game is aloowed to pick the leftmost element in the array and rightmost element in the array.
7. In greedy startegy, players will always pick the greatest element from leftmost arr or rightmost array.
8. In optimal strategy player will play optimally and if in the futute high money he can earn, so at the current picking player can also take small money
 and in future he will more money and eventually earn the better profit.
9. You are to determine exactly how bad the greedy strategy is for different games when ronnie uses it(greedy),but Donnie is free to use any strategy he wishes.

10. Means u need to find the maximum difference between the greedy and optimal strategy.

Constraints :
1. 1<len(arr) <=1000
2. len(arr) is always even
3. Sum of the number in arr<=10^5
