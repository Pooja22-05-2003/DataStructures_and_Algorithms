Problem:
Given array of positive integers of length n (n<=100000)

(a[i]<=100000)
You have to maximize the consecutive integers count in array (Order doesn't matter)
Only operation you are allowed to do with array elements is to make
ai=ai+1 i.e increase the element by one  OR
ai=ai+0 i.e do nothing with element
for all 0<=i<n
E.g 
Input
n=9
arr:1 1 3 4 6 6 6 8 10
ans = 5
Explanation:
You can transform the array to
1 1 4 5 6 7 6 8 10
maximum consecutive length is 5 with elements 4,5,6,7,8.
