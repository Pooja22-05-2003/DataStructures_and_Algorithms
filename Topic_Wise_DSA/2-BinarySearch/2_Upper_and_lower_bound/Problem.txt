Given an array of size n  and an element x
Find  the upper bound of x
Find the lower bound of x

Upper bound - [
Given a sorted array of size “N”; find the index of the number in the array which is just greater than x and as close as possible to x.

-> Upper Bound (x) = Returns index of the number which is just greater than x and as close as possible to x.
-> Lower Bound (x)= Returns index of the number which is just smaller than x and as close as possible to x.
