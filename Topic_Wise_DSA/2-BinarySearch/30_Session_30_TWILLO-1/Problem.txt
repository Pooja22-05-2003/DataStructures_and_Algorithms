Understanding :-> Given arrays B and C ; and budget D ; each element in the array B can 
be multiplied and increased to a new number(any number of time ...but increment can only
happen number equal to itself....for example 4 -> 8 -> 12) ; but there is a cost of 
multiplying which is given by array C

-> Do as many operations as you want but total cost of operations <=D; 

-> Goal -> Minimum value of final array B should be as big as possible!
