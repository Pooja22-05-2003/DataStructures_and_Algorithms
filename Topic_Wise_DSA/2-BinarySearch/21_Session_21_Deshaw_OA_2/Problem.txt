-> Question is saying to us :- We are given an array and integer k ; we have to make maximum k moves on the array such that all elements of array become <=0 ; also -> in each move you can :-> 

Decrease any number of the array by x . 

K = 15 

Task is to find the minimum possible value of x. 

Example :- 

Observation : - When the value of x is small ; total operations are more ; and when value of x is large ; total operations are less. 

[5 8 8 5 5] is our array and max moved allowed are k = 15 ; 

So if you select x = 0 ; —-> you cannot achieve the task. 

If you select x = 1 ; —--> It will take you 31 steps which is > k -> cannot achieve task

If you select x = 2 ; —--> will take you 17 steps which is > k -> cannot achieve the task  

If you select x = 3 ; —--> will take you 12 steps which is <= k —> successfully achieve the task 

If you select x = 4 ; —---> will take you 10 steps which is <=k —> successful 

If you select x = 5 ; —---> successful 

If you select x = 6 ; —--> same success.

.
If you select x = infinity —> still successful


Observation : -> Once you become successful for some x ; you will stay successful for all values >=x ; let's call it the starting point of success. 

So —-> [5 8 8 5 5] ; k = 15 ; answer → 3 
Once ; you become successful for some x = y ; 
Then all x>=y will always be successful ; 

Hence y is the minimum possible answer :)
