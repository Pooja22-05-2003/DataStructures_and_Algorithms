Given an array  and  a value k , u need to pick k points from the array such that , the minimum 
difference between any two points is as maximum as possible.

Ex: 
arr=[1,4,2,9,8]
k=3
output :
3

-> The distance between 1 and 4 = abs(1-4)=3
-> The distance between 1 and 8 => abs(1-8)=7
-> The distance between 4 and 8 => abs(4-8)=>4

So, the minimum among them is 3
