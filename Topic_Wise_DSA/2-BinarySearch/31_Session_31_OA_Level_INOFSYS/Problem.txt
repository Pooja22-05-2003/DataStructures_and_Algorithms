Given an array and an integer p. Find the p pairs in the array, such that maximum differecne difference of the pairs are as minimum as possible. and return that 
maximum difference of the pairs.

Example:
Input : nums=[10,1,2,7,1,3]
p=2

pairs are : (1,1)[diff=0] and (2,3) [diff=1]
Maximum diff is 1
output : 
1


Input 2:
nums=[4,2,1,2] p=1
pair =(2,2) diff=[0]
output=0
