Understanding :-> We are giving you an array of size “M” ; divide the array into at most “N” parts; lets say sum of each part is s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,.......sn 

max(s1,s2,s3,s4…….sn)---> minimum as possible. 


Observation:-> What can be the smallest possible capacity of a bucket 

According to Sheenam’s Law:-> Minimum capacity of the. Bucket is the maximum element of array

According to Karandeep’s Law :-> max capacity of a bucket is sum of array elements  


Final answer will always be in the range [minimum_capacity(N=M),maximum_capacity(N=1)] 

I = minimum_capacity 
-> check(minimum_capacity = i)-> is it possible to divide the array into N parts such that capacity of each bucket is utmost = minimum_capacity 
-> it comes as false; 

->try for check(i+1)-> false;

-> try for check(i+2)->false;

->try for check(i+g)==> true this your answer 

Low = min;
High = max;
