Given an integer k and array, count the number of distinct 
valid pairs of integers (a,b) in the list for which a+k=b. Two 
Pairs of integer (a,b) and (c,d) are connected distinct if at least 
one element of (a,b) does not also belong to (c,d). Note that the elements
in a pair might be the same element in the array. 


An instance of this is below where k=0.


Example 
n=4
numbers=[1,1,1,2]
k=1

output :
1

This array has three different valid pairs:(1,1) and (1,2)
for k=1, there is only 1 valid pair which satisifies a+k=b: the pair(a,b)=(1,2)
