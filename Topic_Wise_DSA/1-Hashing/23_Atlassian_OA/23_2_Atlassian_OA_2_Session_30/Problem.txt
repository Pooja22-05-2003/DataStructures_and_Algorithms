-> Given an array of size N ;  find the maximum sum subarray which has a difference of "k" between the start and end elements of the array

N = 8

K = 5

1 5 -5 8 8 8 10 15

Output - [5 -5 8 8 8 10] = 34. (also difference b/w start and end element is abs(5-10)) = 5

1 <= K <= 100000

1 <= N <= 100000

If there is no subarray with positive then print 0
