You are given an integer array of size n and you have to process Q queries. Each Query will contain
an element X and we have to output the frequency of X in the array .


Note : all the elements in the array will be in the range from 1 to N.

Input  : a[] = {0, 5, 5, 5, 4}
           q=1
           x = 5
Output : 3

Input  : a[] = {1, 2, 3}
          q=2
          x = 4
          x = 3
Output : 0
