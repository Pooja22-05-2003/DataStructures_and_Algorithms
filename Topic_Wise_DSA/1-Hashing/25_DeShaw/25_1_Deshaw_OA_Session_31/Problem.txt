Understanding : We are given an array B of size “N”; Divide the array into 4 continuous parts such that g = part1+part3-(part2+part4) is maximized. 

Any part is allowed to be empty as well ; but collectively they should cover the whole array .

example:
input :
6
-3 4 -5 2 6 -5


output :
19

input 2:
3
-4 1 -1

output :
6
