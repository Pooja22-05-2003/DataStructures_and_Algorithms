Understanding -> Particular timestamps are given in which some packets are sent in the system.
 Also at each second, y packets will be removed from the system. Also ; at any second if the 
 total number of packets > max_capacity ; then you are supposed to remove all the extra packets.
The question is asking total how many packets you will have to remove in this process. 


Constraints :
1<=time(request[i][0])<=1000000000
1<=n<=100000
1<=packet(request[i][1])<=100000000

1<=rate<=100000000

1<=max_packets<=1000000000
(->Each particular time(request[i][0]) comes only for maximum 1 time in the input) 
(-> all request[i][0] are in ascending order)
