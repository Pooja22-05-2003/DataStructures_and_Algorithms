Count Pairs 


You are given the following :
 1. Integers n,c,d
 2. Array a as a1,a2.....an of lenght n
 3. Array b as b1,b2,.....bn of length n

 Task : 
Determine the number of Pairs (i,j):
(i<=i<j<=n) satisying inequality (ai-aj+c)=(bi-bj+d)

Note 
 -> 1 based indexing is followed
 -> 1<=N<=100000
 -> 1<=a[i],b[i]<=1000000000
