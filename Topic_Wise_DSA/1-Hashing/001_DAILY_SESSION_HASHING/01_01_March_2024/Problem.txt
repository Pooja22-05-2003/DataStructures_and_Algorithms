Understanding :- Given an array of size “N” ; in one operation ➖

You can either select any two same elements and remove them from the array 

You can select any three same elements from the array and remove them from the array 


Your task is to destroy the full array in a minimum number of operations! 


According to Tariquddin’s law :-  if  the frequency of any number is 1 then the answer will be -1

According to Yasika’s law :- If the frequency of all numbers is >=2 then the answer is always valid.


How to solve the problem :- To make the visualization easy, store all the numbers in a hashmap with their frequencies.  


If the array is 1 5 5 1 1 8 8 10 10 

Store them in hashmap with the frequencies :- 

According to Tanmai’s Law :- 

{
1 - 3 
5 - 2 
8 - 2 
10 - 2 
}

Next instinct tells that we should try to destroy each of the numbers separately 

If a particular number is coming “x” a number of times then what is the minimum number of operations to destroy x? 

It takes x/3 operations if x is divisible by 3 ; and takes x/3 + 1 operations if x is not divisible by 3 according to the pattern observed!

2 -> 1
3 -> 1
4 -> 2
5 -> 2
6 -> 2
7 -> 3
8 -> 3 (8/3 + 1 = 2 + 1) 
9 -> 3
