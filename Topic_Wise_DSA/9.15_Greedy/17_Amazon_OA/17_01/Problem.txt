Given list of movies, and a variable k representing maximum allowed difference, we need 
to group the movies into groups. No groups can have movies which has difference amongst
 them greater than m. We need to return minimum number of groups which follows the condition.

Example - movies = [1,5,4,6,8,9,2], k=3;
output = 3 [groups-(1,2,4),(5,6,8),(9)]
