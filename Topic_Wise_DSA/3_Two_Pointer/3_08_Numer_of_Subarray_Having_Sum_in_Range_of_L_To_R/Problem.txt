Given an array A[] of N integers and a range(L, R). The task is to find the number of subarrays having sum in the range L to R (inclusive).

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3, L = 3, R = 8
A[] = {1, 4, 6}
Output: 
3
Explanation: 
The subarrays are [1,4], [4] and [6]
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4, L = 4, R = 13
A[] = {2, 3, 5, 8}
Output: 
6
Explanation: 
The subarrays are [2,3], [2,3,5], 
[3,5],[5], [5,8] and [8]
Your Task: 
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function countSubarray( ) which takes the integer N , the array A[], the integer L and the integer R as input parameters and returns the number of subarays. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ A[] ≤ 109
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 1015
