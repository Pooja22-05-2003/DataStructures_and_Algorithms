Given two arrays of size N each containing the elements 1 to N, find the minimum number of operations needed to transform the second array into the first.

An operation is defined as:
Taking any current value in an array and moving it to the beginning or end.

Example:
Turn Array2 into Array1

Array1 = [4,2,3,1,5,6]
Array2 = [3,1,4,6,5,2]

Returns 3:

Operation 1: Move 2 to beginning.
Array2 = [2,3,1,4,6,5]

Operation 2: Move 4 to beginning.
Array2 = [4,2,3,1,6,5]

Operation 3: Move 6 to end:
Array2 = [4,2,3,1,5,6]

 

1<=N<=100000
---------
Understanding of the problem:-> We are given two arrays A and B of size “N”; which have integers strictly from 1 to N coming single times. 

Our task is to convert Array B -> Array A in minimum operations. 

Operation:-> Pick a number from Array B and put it at the start of Array B 

-> Pick up number from Array B and put it at the end of Array B
