Given a sorted integer array and number x, the task is to count pairs in array whose sum is less than x.

Examples: 

Input  : arr[] = {1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11}
         x = 7
Output : 1
There is only one pair (1, 3)
Input  : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
         x = 7
Output : 6
Pairs are (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)
          (2, 3) and (2, 4)
