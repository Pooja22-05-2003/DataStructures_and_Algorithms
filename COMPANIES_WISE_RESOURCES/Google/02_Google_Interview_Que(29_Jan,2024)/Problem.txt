You are given “Q” queries of the type :- 

1<=(x,y)<=100000

-> Add (x,y) 
-> Count(x,y) = count the number of squares you can build with the point (x,y) such that (x,y) is one of the end points of the created square. 

[Square should be parallel to X-axis and Y-axis] 

(x,y) can be the same for multiple queries. 

-> Add(5,4)
-> Add(8,4)
-> Add(8,1)
-> Count(5,1) 

->read(n);b-> array of pairs.
