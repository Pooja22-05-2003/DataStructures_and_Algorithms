Given an undirected graph consisting of N vertices , numbers from 0 to N-1,
connected with M edges. The graph is descibed by 2 two arrays A and B, both of length
M. A pair (A[k],B[k]), for K from 0 to M-1, desccirbes edge vertex from A[k] and vertex B[k].

Each second , every vertex with at most one edge connected to it disappear.
Every edge which is connected to one of the disappearing edge , vertices also disappear.

After how many , seconds will the vertices stop disappearing.

Ex:
N=7
A=[0,1,2,4,5]
B=[1,2,3,5,6]

Output:
2 

After the first second, vertices 0,3,4 and 6 will disappear.

During the next second, all of the remaiing vertices disappear. so the answer is 2.


Input 2:
N=4
A=[0,1,2,3]
B=[1,2,3,0]

Output 
0
