*** There can be 3 types of questions , which can be framed using this.


1. Given row and col number , find the element in pascals triangle
2. Given the row number , find the row of that pascal triangle
3. Given n print the whole pascals triangle

Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 5 6 4 1



Example 1:

Input: numRows = 5
Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
Example 2:

Input: numRows = 1
Output: [[1]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= numRows <= 30
